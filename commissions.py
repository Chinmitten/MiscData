# What I'm doing here is creating the logic for a matching payment using Lists in HubSpot
# From there, I'm exporting it, creating a dataframe for it plus the Held Commissions CSV
# We're joining "Email" from the HubsData CSV with "customer_external_key" from the Held Commissions CSV
# If there's a match, we'll update the "Pay" column in the Held Commissions CSV to "Pay"
# This is the list https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/20341965/objectLists/29498/filters
# It can be re-used with other partners if needed.

# Define desktop path
desktop_path = os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop")  # This works on both macOS and Windows

# File paths â€” ReName this in future if needed.
